            Star Furfriend: Anya
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
        Anya is a 2 years old Russion Blue. She is very lovely and craves a lot of attention. 
        She likes to be petted and loves purring. 
        She can be very skittish in front of strangers. 
        Once she gets to know you, she becomes a very sweet and cute cat. 
        Although she likes to wash her feet from people's cup and likes to eat flowers, she is generally a well behaved cat.

            Star Furfriend: JoJo
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
        JoJo is a cute Maltipoo. She is super sweet to females and can be fierce to males. 
        However, she is as skittish as anya when she goes outside. Even though, she loves going outside. 
        She prefers sitting in the car or being carried by someone more than walking by herself. 
        She thinks herself as a human probably, as she hates playing with other dogs.
